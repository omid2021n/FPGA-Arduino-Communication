# FPGA-Arduino-Communication  
Project Highlight: FPGA & Arduino Communication 
Iâ€™ve designed an exciting project to explore the communication between an FPGA (using the Altera MAXII EPM240 CPLD development board) and Arduino UNO. In this setup, the Arduino is used to blink the LED on pin 13, providing a source signal for the FPGA to process.
Key Features:
Arduino controls LED blink on pin 13.
FPGA (Altera EPM240) receives and processes the signal.
For 3.3V-5V 4 Channels Logic Level Converter Bi-Directional Shifter Module
Demonstrates seamless communication between an embedded system and FPGA for real-time signal handling.
This project opens up new opportunities for learning and experimentation with hardware communication, perfect for those working in embedded systems and FPGA development.
